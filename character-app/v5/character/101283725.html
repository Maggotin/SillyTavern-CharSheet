<p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
    While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.</p>\r\n<p>The staff has
    20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the
    last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other
    properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Power Strike.</strong> When you hit with a
    melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.</p>\r\n<p>
    <strong>Spells.</strong> While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast
    one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: <strong></strong><strong>cone
    of cold</strong> (5 charges), <strong></strong><strong>fireball</strong> (5th-level version, 5 charges),
    <strong></strong><strong>globe of invulnerability</strong> (6 charges), <strong></strong><strong>hold

    (5 charges).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Retributive Strike.</strong> You can use an action to break the staff over your knee
    or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic
    in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.</p>\r\n<p>You have a 50 percent chance

<p>The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil’s thrall. No
    mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages
    invites madness.</p>\r\n<p>Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>. He recorded
    in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or
    devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.</p>\r\n
<p>Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their
    additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some
    cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn, or covered so
    completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can’t be divined.</p>\r\n<p>Nature can’t abide the
    book’s presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book
    gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long
    enough.</p>\r\n<p>A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents
    and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book’s contents, provided that those modifications
    advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.</p>\r\n<p>Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the
    <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em>, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the
    creature’s alignment changes to neutral evil.</p>\r\n<p>The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> remains with you only as
    long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10
    days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity
    of great evil claims your soul. You can’t be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.
</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Random Properties.</em></strong> The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> has the following random
    properties:</p>\r\n
<ul>\r\n
    <li>3 minor beneficial properties</li>
    \r\n
    <li>1 major beneficial property</li>
    \r\n
    <li>3 minor detrimental properties</li>
    \r\n
    <li>2 major detrimental properties</li>
    \r\n
</ul>\r\n<p><strong><em>Adjusted Ability Scores.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and
    studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of
    your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can’t adjust your ability scores again.</p>\r\n<p>
    <strong><em>Mark of Darkness.</em></strong> After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the
    book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might
    appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might
    become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses.
    The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and
    Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Command
    Evil.</em></strong> While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate
    monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can’t use this property again until the next dawn.</p>\r\n<p>
    <strong><em>Dark Lore.</em></strong> You can reference the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> whenever you make an
    Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so,
    double your proficiency bonus on that check.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Dark Speech.</em></strong> While you carry the
    <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite words from its pages in a foul
    language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within
    15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Destroying the Book.</em></strong> The <em>Book of
    Vile Darkness</em> allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back
    into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.</p>\r\n<p>If a solar tears the book in
    two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.</p>\r\n<p>
    A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when
    translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance.
    However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 &times; 100 years later.</p>\r\n<p>If all
    evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.</p>\r\n
<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Vile Lore</strong></p>\r\n<p>The <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> touches on every evil in the
    cosmos. A character can use the lore the book contains to unearth terrible secrets no mortal should know. Among the
    contents a character might find are the following, plus whatever else you choose:</p>\r\n
    <ul>\r\n
        <li><strong>Vile Apotheosis.</strong> The book could hold a ritual that allows a character to become a lich or
            death knight.
        </li>
        \r\n
        <li><strong>True Names.</strong> The true names of any number of fiends might be in the book.</li>
        \r\n
        <li><strong>Dark Magic.</strong> Several spells of horrific evil of the DM’s design and choosing could be in the
            book. Spells could impose dreadful curses, disfigure others, require human sacrifice, afflict creatures with
            crippling pain, spread vile plagues, and so on.
        </li>
        \r\n
    </ul>

    You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\"

    id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p
    class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer
    spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of&nbsp;the spell’s
    level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p
    class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast,
    choosing from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\"
    href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a
    number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of
    one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">
    For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an
    Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If
    you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the
    spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change
    your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time
    spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
    list.</p>\r\n
<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p
    class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your
    spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using
    alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a
    miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a
    wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method
    of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you
    prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work
    with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with
    heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat
    instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way
    or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast
    a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other
    spellcasters.</p>\r\n
</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p
    class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your
    understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your
    Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
    modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with

    yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the

    Servant</h5>\r\n<p><em>Item: A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn intricate methods for
    magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature’s heart, around
    which the creature’s body instantly forms.</p>\r\n<p>You determine the homunculus’s appearance. Some artificers
    prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.</p>\r\n<p>The
    homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics
    in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>\r\n<p>In combat,
    the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its
    reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on
    your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If
    you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\r\n<p>The homunculus
    regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its
    heart in its space.</p>\r\n

    as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p>The weapon has 4 charges. As a reaction immediately after being hit by an attack, the

    loading property if it has it.</p>\r\n<p>If the weapon lacks ammunition, it produces its own, automatically creating

<p>Arcane Science is an arcane tradition fixated on understanding the underlying mechanics of magic. Its the category of
    disciplines and subdisciplines in the field of arcane science that are concerned with the observation of arcane
    phenomena and experiments. Methods vary from discipline to discipline, from simple experiments and observations,
    such as the Aether-Light experiments, to more complicated ones, such as the Large Arcane Collider.</p>\r\n<p>
    Experimental arcane science regroups all the disciplines of arcane science that are concerned with data acquisition,
    data&ndash;acquisition methods, and the detailed conceptualization (beyond simple thought experiments) and
    realization of experiments. It is often put in contrast with theoretical arcane science, which is more concerned
    with predicting and explaining the physical behaviour of nature than the acquisition of knowledge about it.</p>\r\n
<p>The hunger for more data and the observation of new arcane phenomena is what lets these scientist rise from their
    laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure. The results of a spell are less interesting to
    them than the process that creates it. Although experimental and other arcane users are concerned with different
    aspects of magic and nature, they share the same goal of understanding it and have a symbiotic relation.</p>\r\n<p>
    Your talent and aptitude for the manipulation of arcane energy is second to none, allowing you to do things with
    magic that other artificers, even those with decades more experience, wouldn’t dream of attempting. Whether it’s

    id=\"preparing-and-casting-spells\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>\r\n<p>From 1st level the Artificer table shows
    how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or
    higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
    long rest.</p>\r\n<p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the
    artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half
    your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
    slots.</p>\r\n<p><em>3rd-level Armorer feature</em></p>\r\n<p>From 3rd level the Wizard table shows how many spell
    slots you have to cast your artificer and wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
    must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long
    rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level Artisan, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.
    With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
    combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a
    1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p>You
    can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time
    spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least
    1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"spellcasting-ability\">Spellcasting
    Ability</h4>\r\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer and wizard spells, since you learn

    class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer

    level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p

    one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">
    For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an
    Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If
    you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the
    spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change
    your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time
    spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
    list.</p>\r\n
<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p
    class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your
    spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using
    alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a
    miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a
    wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method
    of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you
    prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work
    with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with
    heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat
    instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way
    or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast
    a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other
    spellcasters.</p>\r\n

    the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its
    reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on
    your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If
    you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\r\n<p>The homunculus
    regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its
    heart in its space.</p>\r\n

    or robes</em></p>\r\n<p>The infused item can send a jolt to the wearer to refocus their mind. The item has 4
    charges. When the wearer fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, the wearer can use
    its reaction to expend 1 of the item’s charges to succeed instead. The item regains 1d4 expended charges daily at

    artificer<br/>Item: A simple or martial weapon (requires attunement)</em></p>\r\n<p>This magic weapon grants a +1
    bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, the wielder can take a bonus action to cause it to
    shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The wielder can extinguish the light
    as a bonus action.</p>\r\n<p>The weapon has 4 charges. As a reaction immediately after being hit by an attack, the
    wielder can expend 1 charge and cause the attacker to be blinded until the end of the attacker’s next turn, unless
    the attacker succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The weapon regains 1d4 expended
    charges daily at dawn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"RepeatingShot\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Repeating Shot</h5>\r\n<p><em>Item: A
    simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement)</em></p>\r\n<p>This magic weapon grants
    a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it’s used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the
    loading property if it has it.</p>\r\n<p>If the weapon lacks ammunition, it produces its own, automatically creating
    one piece of magic ammunition when the wielder makes a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon
    vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"ReplicateMagicItem\" class=\"compendium-hr\">
    Replicate Magic Item</h5>\r\n<p>Using this infusion, you replicate a particular magic item. You can learn this

    Replicable Items tables. A table’s title tells you the level you must be in the class to choose an item from the
    table. Alternatively, you can choose the magic item from among the common magic items in the game, not including
    potions or scrolls.</p>\r\n<p>In the tables, an item’s entry tells you whether the item requires attunement. See the
    item’s description in the <em><a class=\"sourcebook\" title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\"

<p><em>3rd-level Arcane Artisan feature</em></p>\r\n<h4 id=\"spellbook\"><strong>Spellbook</strong></h4>\r\n<p>At 3rd
    level, you compile a spellbook called Artificer's Workbook. Your spellbook is the repository of the artificer and
    wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h4
    id=\"preparing-and-casting-spells\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>\r\n<p>From 1st level the Artificer table shows
    how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or
    higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
    long rest.</p>\r\n<p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the
    artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half
    your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
    slots.</p>\r\n<p><em>3rd-level Armorer feature</em></p>\r\n<p>From 3rd level the Wizard table shows how many spell
    slots you have to cast your artificer and wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
    must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long
    rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level Artisan, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.
    With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
    combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a
    1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p>You
    can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time
    spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least
    1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h4 id=\"spellcasting-ability\">Spellcasting
    Ability</h4>\r\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer and wizard spells, since you learn
    your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your
    spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a

    has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h4
    id=\"spellcasting-focus\">Spellcasting Focus</h4>\r\n<p>You can use an arcane focus or tinker's tools (see the
    Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h4
    id=\"learning-spells-of-3rd-level-and-higher\">Learning Spells of 3rd Level and Higher</h4>\r\n<p>Each time you gain
    a level, you can add two artificer or wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells
    must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find

        like your other spells.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua', palatino, serif;\"><strong>Replacing
        the Book.</strong>&nbsp;You can copy a spell from your own codex into another book--for example, if you want to

        easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to infuse the spell. You need spend only 1
        hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'book antiqua',
        palatino, serif;\">If you lose your codex, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have
        prepared into a new codex. Filling out the remainder of your codex requires you to find new spells to do so, as
        normal. For this reason, many artificers keep backup codex in a safe place.</span></p>\r\n<p><span

        codex is a unique compilation of spells, designs, and architecture, with its own decorative flourishes and

    \r\n
    <li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You

    you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an &lsquo;M’ component when you cast it).
    You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\"

    can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\r\n<h5
    id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p
    class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer
    spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of&nbsp;the spell’s
    level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p
    class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast,
    choosing from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\"
    href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a
    number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of
    one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">
    For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an
    Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If
    you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the
    spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change
    your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time
    spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
    list.</p>\r\n
<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p
    class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your
    spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using
    alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a
    miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a
    wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method
    of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you
    prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work
    with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with
    heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat
    instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way
    or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast
    a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other
    spellcasters.</p>\r\n
</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p
    class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your
    understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your
    Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
    modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
    one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span

    and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain
    kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune
    yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the
    normal process for attunement (see &ldquo;<a title=\"Attunement\"

    \r\n
    <li>The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is
        holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals 1d8 force damage on a hit and
        has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet
        detaches and flies at the attack’s target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.

    <li>When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the
        roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.
    </li>
    \r\n

    Servant</h5>\r\n<p><em>Item: A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp</em></p>\r\n<p>You learn intricate methods for
    magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature’s heart, around
    which the creature’s body instantly forms.</p>\r\n<p>You determine the homunculus’s appearance. Some artificers
    prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.</p>\r\n<p>The
    homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics
    in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>\r\n<p>In combat,
    the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its
    reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on
    your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If
    you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>\r\n<p>The homunculus
    regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its
    heart in its space.</p>\r\n

    loading property if it has it.</p>\r\n<p>If the weapon lacks ammunition, it produces its own, automatically creating

</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Familiarity.</strong> \"Permanent circle\" means a permanent teleportation
    circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired
    destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a
    chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.</p>\r\n<p>\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place
    you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have
    seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly
    using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description,
    perhaps from a map.</p>\r\n<p>\"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an
    enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no
    longer exists.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want
    to.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Off Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away
    from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 &times; 1d10 percent of the distance that
    was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the
    two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target
    randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the
    compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
</p>\r\n<p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's
    visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you

    (Divination)<br/>(Intended for use with the Chronomancer subclass)</em></p>\r\n
<div>Focus on an object or feature in sight.&nbsp; As the caster concentrates, their left eye begins to witness time in
    reverse, seeing further and further into the past.&nbsp; Simultaneously, their right eye begins to see time progress
    at an accelerated rate, seeing further and further into the (currently-most statistically-probable) future.&nbsp;
    Through their left eye, they might see burnt paper unburn, and become readable, then as time continued back, watch
    the words \"unwrite\" themselves off the page, leaving a blank parchment.&nbsp; They might see people or creatures
    pass through a space in reverse.&nbsp; Through their right eye, they might see an unused new journal begin to form
    words on its pages as they \"write themselves\" in, then after some time, get torn, or scribbled over, or fade.&nbsp;
    This might allow the caster to view the combination of a currently-secured lock at some time when it was (or will
    be) solved and open.&nbsp; They might also attempt to read a lost spell scroll, or examine a destroyed piece of
    evidence.&nbsp; Maybe determine what someone else is planning based on what they write, or how an object&nbsp;will
    be primed in the future, and then prepare against that outcome beforehand.
</div>\r\n
<div><strong>Area of Effect:</strong><br/>Typically, this spell is cast and then the caster spends all of their
    attention on the focused-upon object or area.&nbsp; However, the caster may wish to look around at their
    surroundings with anachronistic vision, or even walk about and observe the area as it once was or likely someday
    will be.&nbsp; This requires a Wisdom saving throw of DC 15.&nbsp; Failure means the caster becomes disoriented with
    a sense of vertigo, and must cease movement and focus solely on the original target of the spell in order to avoid
    losing concentration.&nbsp; They cannot attempt to look around at their surroundings again until the spell is cast
    anew.
</div>\r\n
<div><strong>Rate of Change and Control of Flow:</strong><br/>For the entire round spent actually casting the spell, the
    caster sees the past/next 24 hours (4 hours per second).&nbsp; They may change or pause the perceived flow of time&nbsp;by
    performing a Wisdom save, as though 0 rounds have passed so far.&nbsp; After this first round has passed, the caster
    may change the rate of the vision once per round.
</div>\r\n
<div style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Rates are:</span>
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stopped,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; One second per round, <br/>&gt; &gt; One minute per round,<br/>
<span class=\"il\">&gt; One hour</span> per round,<br/>One day per round (DEFAULT),<br/>&gt; One week per round,
<br/>&gt; &gt; One month per round,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; One year per round,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One decade per round,
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One century per round</div>\r\n
<div style=\"padding-left:
     30px;\">Each attempt to change this rate may only shift over a number of rate categories equal to or less than the caster's Wisdom modifier.&nbsp; Each change in rate prompts an immediate Wisdom check of
<br/>[ DC (9 - 1&nbsp;per every 2 caster levels) + (number of&nbsp;rounds spent concentrating so far) + (number of rate categories attempting to change this round) ]</div>\r\n
<div>So for example, shifting from days/round to full-stop is a difference of 4 rates.&nbsp; If the caster is Level 3
    and was concentrating for 6 rounds at this point, then the DC is (9 - (level 3 / 2)) + 6 rounds + 4 rate = DC 18.&nbsp;
    Shifting from centuries/round to full-stop after concentrating for a minute would be (9 - (level 3 / 2)) + 10 rounds
    + 9 rate = DC 27.&nbsp; A level 20 caster would attempt the same shift as (9 - (level 20 / 2)) + 10 rounds + 9 rate
    = DC 18.&nbsp; Shifting one rate category per round prompts more checks, but each check will have a lower DC to
    contend with, and may be necessary for lower-level casters who wish ultimately to shift across many rate categories.
</div>\r\n
<div>Failing this Wisdom save causes the caster to immediately suffer a debilitating migraine for 1d20 minutes
    (Disadvantage to all Int and Wis skills and saves).&nbsp; This also immediately ends the spell, unless the caster
    chooses to suffer one level of exhaustion.&nbsp; No rate shift can be attempted&nbsp;while the caster is suffering a
    migraine, and additional castings of this spell automatically fail until the migraine clears.
</div>\r\n
<div>Observing only events of either only the past or only the future exclusively requires the caster to cover or close
    the opposite eye.&nbsp; Casters missing one or both eyes, or otherwise blinded, can actually still see out of the
    appropriate eye socket(s) for the duration of this spell, and still need to go through the same physical motions to
    block one side or the other.
</div>\r\n
<div>The material components of this spell are a piece of red glass and a piece of blue glass, each of which are held up
    to the caster's eyes.

    you infuse a specially prepared receptacle with pure arcane energy. The receptacle must be an object that can be
    closed, like a pot, a bottle, or a container of any kind. Once you fill the receptacle with the arcane energy, it
    remains infused, until you use the energy for something. You can attach the battery to various objects, in order to
    generate a plethora of effects, as described bellow.</p>\r\n<p>The receptacle has AC 18 and 5 hit points. If its
    destroyed, the energy inside it becomes unstable and explosive, forcing all creatures within a 5-foot radius of the
    receptacle to make a&nbsp;Dexterity&nbsp;saving throw, or take 2d6 force damage. The receptacle also explodes 1
    round after being opened.</p>\r\n<p><br/><b>Powering Objects</b>&nbsp;You can use the battery to power a 10 pound
    object at 10 feet of movement speed. You command the object to move as a bonus action, while you are within at least
    60 feet of it. You can make an object fly for half the movement speed. The battery depletes after 8 hours of
    constant movement. You can increase the size or the weight of the object moved by increasing the number of batteries
    attached to it.</p>\r\n<p><b>Animating Objects</b>&nbsp;You can use the battery to infuse an artificial mind into an
    object. With one battery, you can infuse one tiny object with life and sentience for 10 minutes. If the object
    infused has the shape of a tiny object, the animated object will have the same game statistics of that animal, being
    a construct instead of a beast.</p>\r\n<p><b>Generating Energy</b>&nbsp;You can use the battery to ignite flammable
    substances or to keep any creature holding it warm, granting advantage on any checks to support cold environments.
    In addition, you can use the battery to lit a lantern or a similar object. Each battery counts as 10 flasks of oil.
</p>\r\n<p><b>Arcane Blaster</b>&nbsp;You can attach the battery to an arcane focus, in order to create a arcane
    blaster. The arcane blaster is a ranged simple weapon, with a short range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet,
    and deals 1d6 force damage. While attached to an arcane focus, it generate bright light up to a range of 10 feet and
    dim light for more 10 feet. You can make 10 attacks with it after depleting the battery completely.

    Modes:</strong><br/>There are two \"modes\", or mind-frames, in which this spell may be cast.&nbsp; It is simplest
    to think about this difference in the following way: cast the spell targeting a volume of MATTER, or cast the spell
    targeting a volume of SPACE.</p>\r\n<p>In the former case, the subjective and causal passage of time from the
    matter's perspective is altered.&nbsp; Time begins to accelerate, causing the reactions, wear and tear, loss or
    expenditure, and increase of entropy to affect the matter itself.&nbsp; Metal could rust, and crumble.&nbsp; Bread
    could mold, flowers wither, silver tarnish, a lit log burn to charcoal, etc.&nbsp; In the reverse form, the spell
    causes the subjective flow of time to be reversed, rust or broken metal reforming and renewing, moldy food returning
    to freshness, dead flowers returning, etc.&nbsp; This is the only \"safe\" form in which this spell can be cast
    (base 0% chance of&nbsp;a disturbance to the demiplane of time, no chance of paradox), and this is the only
    functionality this spell can ever have if cast by any magic user other than a Chronomancer (who do not understand
    the far more advanced details of space and time's codependent relationship).</p>\r\n<p>In the latter case, a fixed
    volume of space is focused upon and -like the window on a slide-rule- is temporally slid forward or backward through
    time.&nbsp; This region of space can be anything the Chronomancer decides; the space bounded by a wine bottle, or by
    a window frame, or immediately surrounding a page of paper, for example.&nbsp; The contents within the volume of
    space change to reflect what WAS/WILL BE inside that space at the point in time the spell moves the slider to.&nbsp;
    Words on a page that are most likely to be written may appear if sliding forward; or if already written, will
    disappear if rolled far enough back.&nbsp; A seemingly-\"empty\" region of space, such as a shattered window-frame,
    may suddenly fill with intact glass if rolled back to a point when they were undamaged; or if rolled forward, a

             (add one round to the casting time for each companion). Lifelines trail off into the silver mist that
             surrounds them. If there is heavy turbulence in the area, the travelers are displaced slightly so that they
             are relatively safe. When slipping bakc from Temporal Prime, the caster must focus on a lifeline to make
             the connection with reality. The Chronomancer ends up within 1d10 miles of the creature that lifeline
             corresponds to. This feature also helps the Chronomancer who wishes to intersect a specific lifeline. All
             the Chronomancer is wearing or carrying slips with him, up to a maximum of 25 pounds per level. Also, for
             every two levels, the Chronomancer may slip one additional person along on the trip. If the target is
             reluctant, a Will save negates the entire spell. The material components for this spell are a diaphanous
             square of fine silk and a small piece of basalt.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:14720,&quot;10&quot;:0,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,0],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}\">Based

    proficiency in the Arcana skill. Each enhancement (1&ndash;8) must be completed in order and cannot be
    redone.</p>\r\n<p>As the enhancement of a familiar continues, the familiar should develop a personality that seems
    almost human, displaying specific traits, likes, dislikes, opinions, habits, and foibles. Its animal qualities also
    develop as its personality matures. A black cat might develop discriminating and expensive tastes in food and
    creature comforts; a crow might become a collector of gaudy gemstones and jewelry; and an otter might develop a
    frolicsome personality combining a short attention span for serious matters with a love for playful pranks.</p>\r\n
<p>The familiar takes on some of your alignment and attitudes, though a leaning toward a neutral alignment, a holdover
    from its simple animal origin, will always remain. The familiar may tend to become more of an independent NPC as it
    is enhanced. The DM should carefully consider if relaxing the dependency of the familiar on the wizard will improve
    the campaign play.</p>\r\n<h5>Enhancement Costs</h5>\r\n

    minutes of normal time.&nbsp;While a creature works at this bench, they do not need to eat, drink, or sleep, and do

    must make a wisdom saving throw against a&nbsp;simulated spell dc based on the type of information sought. The chart
    below will tell how to calculate the dice roll to beat. On a failure the holder will suffer one level of exhaustion
    and be&nbsp;unable to learn what is contained in the magical material component . On a critical failure the holder
    suffers an additional level of exhaustion in addition to learning nothing. Subsequent attempts can be made but run
    the risk of higher levels of exhaustion (up to and eventually including killing oneself). Once the information is
    successfully transferred, the material component becomes non-magical and loses whatever records it has on it. If the
    holder wants to avoid exhaustion they can also wear gloves and 1.) in the case of the book, simply read the content
    written and attempt to understand through written word the target's experience/knowledge or 2.) in the case of the
    crystal, look through the crystal and see the memories as the target remembers them and also hear the sounds as
    well. In both cases the experience/knowledge isn't directly transferred and therefore only a little of the
    information can be understood per day. A lifetime of experience resulting in masterful ability would require a
    lifetime to comprehend fully this way but roughly the equivalent of six months to a year of studying the crystal or
    book could lead the holder to achieve proficiency instead without the need to pay anyone (except in terms of using
    the material component) or convince anyone to become a teacher.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For
    every spell slot above third&nbsp;level used to cast this spell, the holder of the magical component can subtract an
    additional one from the below calculation. (A higher level caster is better at casting the spell and therefore the
    transfer from whomever is holding the magical component has an easier time with the information/knowledge/or

    plays a harp wants to learn a new instrument, and casts Tutor on another Bard who knows the flute. He attains a
    competent amount of information in the crystal he used for the spell and his fellow Bard fails his wisdom saving
    throw and is therefore none the wiser. The bard (who is wearing gloves) takes his crystal someplace quiet and
    attempts to touch it after taking one glove off. His charisma is 16 and he is level 5&nbsp;so he will roll a d20 and
    needs to beat (18-3)-3 which is 12. He rolls and makes it with a 13 on his d20. He learns how to play a flute with
    an average competency level (nothing to write home about but enough to entertain a bit). If he had rolled a anywhere
    from&nbsp;a two to a ten he would have suffered one level of exhaustion. The bard then decides to do it again with a
    different entertainer who plays the piano but this time he must beat a 16 because of the penalty(4+12). Again, the
    entertainer fails his wisdom saving throw. &nbsp;The bard is again also the holder as he takes it off someplace
    private. He rolls a 16 for his d20. On a tie, nothing happens meaning no information is learned but no exhaustion
    occurs either. He rolls again, and this time he rolls a nine which results in one level of exhaustion. He decides to
    quit while he is ahead and takes a long rest. After a long rest, he rolls again and this time gets nineteen. The
    bard is now able to play the piano, harp, and flute, but next time he uses the spell and holds the created magical
    object with his bare hands he will suffer a +8 penalty and therefore must overcome ((18-3)-3) +8 which is twenty and
    therefore impossible for him to overcome (the best he can hope for is a tie) unless he gains levels or increases his
    ability score in some way. He can still cast the spell and give or sell the magical material component to someone
    else.</span></p>","sourceId":null},{"id":7460,"label":"Diving Orb","description":"<p>You create a bubble of air that

    circular, horizontal plane of force, 5 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in a
    space of your choice that you can see within range. If the space is occupied the disc appears flat along the ground
    below and rises up to the 3 feet lifting what was on it. If that which was on it cannot be lifted such as being too
    heavy (greater than 500 lbs) or fixed in place the spell fails but the spell slot is not wasted. When created the
    disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it then it cannot move and
    if the total weight exceeds 1,000 lbs the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.</p>\r\n<p>The
    disk has 3 modes: follow, control, elevation. You can use a bonus action to change the mode. It begins in follow
    mode unless you choose otherwise (for example you can create a disk in elevation mode allowing you to create it in
    the air up to 100 feet above the ground - useful if you need to descend safely from a great height).</p>\r\n<p>
    <strong>Follow</strong> mode:<br/><br/>For this mode the disk must be within 1 to 3 feet from the ground. It cannot
    enter this mode if it is outside of these limits. In this mode the disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of
    it. If you are, or you move, more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet
    of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation
    change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit
    if it was created at the bottom. If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move
    around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Control </strong>mode:<br/><br/>For this mode
    the disk must be within 1 to 3 feet from the ground. It cannot enter this mode if it is outside of these limits. In
    this mode the disk is immobile unless you use your action to move it. With your action you can move it up to 30 feet
    and this movement follows the same rules as in the <strong>follow</strong> mode. You cannot actively move the disk a
    distance that would make it greater than 100 feet from you. If you move more than 100 feet from the disk the spell
    ends. If you move the disk to a space where the ground is greater than 10 feet below you can do so only by combining
    it with your bonus action to immediately change it to <strong>Elevation</strong> mode otherwise the move attempt
    fails.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Elevation</strong> mode:</p>\r\n<p>In this mode the disk is immobile unless you use your
    action to move it. With your action you can move it up to 30 feet but can only move it up or down in a straight
    line. You cannot move it beyond 100 feet of the ground or from you. When not being moved it remains at the current
    elevated level until you move it again or the spell ends. If the spell ends (except as a result of too much weight
    described above) while in Elevation mode the disk remains and you cannot control it as the disk falls evenly at a
    rate of 60 feet per round until it is within 3 feet of a solid surface and then disappears causing whatever was on
    it to fall. While in this mode you can use your action to move the disk 5 feet to the side to be over ground if you

    again.</p>\r\n<p>You can attempt to shove enemies within 15 feet of you. When you successfully shove an opponent
    with Bone Shield, it takes damage as if hit by one of your unarmed strikes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong>
</p>\r\n<p>When you use Bone Shield to impose disadvantage on an attack roll, the creature making the attack has
    disadvantage on not only that attack, but subsequent attacks on the same target for the rest of its turn.</p>\r\n<p>
    When you extend your Bone Shield to give advantage on a Dexterity saving throw, the target takes half damage even if
    they fail their saving throw.</p>\r\n<p>You gain an additional special use of your ability to extend your bone
    plating, Immortal Bone Shield.&nbsp; You can protect yourself and all allies within 15 feet of you as a reaction.&nbsp;
    Until the beginning of your next turn, you and all allies within range have advantage on Dexterity saving throws and
    all attack rolls against you and your allies within range have disadvantage.&nbsp; If you or your allies succeed on
    a Dexterity saving throw while affected, no damage is taken. If they fail, they take half damage anyway.&nbsp;
    Allies that move more than 15 feet away from you lose the protection given by this ability.</p>\r\n<p>Once you use

    slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.&nbsp; The damage increases by 1d8 if the
    target is an undead, celestial or fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.&nbsp; You may use spell slots you receive from other
    classes or necrografts.</p>\r\n<p>When you use Profane Smite, you cannot simultaneously use Ghoul Strike (from the
    Ghoul Claws necrograft) or Wight Strike (from the Wight's Heart necrograft).</p>\r\n<p>You understand the writings
    and inscriptions on any grave, tomb, or similar structure regardless of what language it is. You also understand
    magical runes on such structures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can cast the <em>Paladin’s Anguish</em> cantrip at will.&nbsp;
    This acts like the <em>Toll the Dead</em> cantrip, but half the damage is necrotic and half is radiant.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>\r\n<p>You gain the Profane Sense ability.&nbsp; The presence of both strong evil and good registers on your senses
    like rotting flesh.&nbsp; As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your
    next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 100 feet of you.&nbsp; <em>This sense can
        penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or
        3 feet of wood or dirt.&nbsp; </em>You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence
    you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you
    also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

    the writings, inscriptions, and runes on any grave, tomb, or similar structure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong>

    <em>Staggering Smite</em>.</p>\r\n<p>You can spend an action to summon a twisted visage of the paladin you devoured
    long ago.&nbsp; You gain the Summon Corrupted Crusader ability.&nbsp; Choose a 10-foot square within 60 feet of you.&nbsp;
    A grave or tomb identical to the one you destroyed bursts from the ground.&nbsp; Any creatures in the area must make
    a Dexterity saving throw.&nbsp; A creature takes 8d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a
    successful one.&nbsp; This counts as damage from a magical source.</p>\r\n<p>At the start of your next turn, the
    ghostly paladin emerges from its tomb and begins assailing your enemies for 1 minute.&nbsp; Each turn, the paladin
    makes an unerring attack against an enemy within 5 feet of it.&nbsp; The attack automatically hits and deals 2d8 +
    your Constitution modifier damage, half necrotic and half radiant.&nbsp; The paladin acts independently; you need
    not spend any bonus actions commanding it.&nbsp; The paladin has a fly speed of 40 feet (hover).&nbsp; It can be
    affected by Turn Undead, but is otherwise immune to attacks, spells, and abilities.&nbsp; Its Wisdom saving throw

    Another soul, or fragments of it, inhabits your body along with your own.&nbsp; This may be the result of deliberate
    action on your part. In this situation, you ritualistically consumed a humanoid corpse.&nbsp; However, this
    necrograft could also be caused by a lost soul attaching itself to you without your knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>This is a
    unique necrograft.&nbsp; Normally, you temporarily activate a necrograft by expending a spell slot.&nbsp; However,
    because you actually invite in (or are effectively possessed by) another creature's soul, it cannot be turned on and
    off.</p>\r\n<p>The necrograft has four different power levels: Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, and the most powerful,
    Stage 4.&nbsp; The benefits are cumulative, if you activate the necrograft at Stage 2, you also gain the benefits
    described in Stage 1.&nbsp; The DC of any features gained through this necrograft is your spell DC.</p>\r\n<p>
    Activating the necrograft at Stage 1 requires expending a spell slot of at least 3rd level.</p>\r\n<p>Activating the
    necrograft at Stage 2 requires expending a spell slot of at least 5th level.</p>\r\n<p>Activating the necrograft at
    Stage 3 requires expending a spell slot of at least 7th level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Activating the necrograft at Stage 4
    requires expending a 9th level spell slot.</p>\r\n<p>When you first cast this spell, you no longer regain one 3rd
    level spell slot when you regain your other spell slots.&nbsp; You can regain it only by expending a spell slot high
    enough to activate the necrograft at the next stage, but then you no longer regain a spell slot of that level.&nbsp;
    For example, Larry the necromancer acquired this necrograft at 5th level. He is now 11th level and he wants to
    activate this necrograft at Stage 2. He expends a 5th or 6th level spell slot.&nbsp; When he regains his spell
    slots, he regains one fewer 5th level spell slot.&nbsp; However, he now regains the 3rd spell slot that he expended
    to originally gain this necrograft.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, while other necrografts can simply be acquired and
    activated at any Stage that the spellcaster has enough power to reach, this necrograft works differently.&nbsp; It
    must originally be cast at Stage 1.&nbsp; The caster must wait at least 1 month before advancing the necrograft to
    the next Stage.</p>\r\n<p>At any given time, you can have up to four necrografts active.&nbsp; One cannot exceed
    Stage 1, one can be up to Stage 2, one can be up to Stage 3, and one can be up to Stage 4.</p>\r\n<p>This spell was
    originally designed as part of the Necrografter class, which can be found on DnDBeyond.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage
    1</strong></p>\r\n<p>You gain the Another’s Flesh ability.&nbsp; At will, you can spend an action to physically take
    on the form of the soul that shares your body.&nbsp; Once you select the appearance of that soul, it cannot be
    changed.</p>\r\n<p>This acts like the Change Appearance benefit of <em>Alter Self</em>, with three key differences.&nbsp;
    First, this ability requires no concentration.&nbsp; Second, there are no restrictions on adopting a different size;
    a halfling can physically transform into a goliath and vice versa.&nbsp; Your clothes and equipment adjust to your
    new size.&nbsp; While this transformation affects your height and weight, the only mechanical difference is your
    carrying capacity.&nbsp; Your stats are not changed as though affected by <em>Enlarge</em> or <em>Reduce</em>.&nbsp;
    Third, while this transformation does not actually change the clothes and equipment you are wearing beyond their
    size, if you wish, they can appear to change as if you had cast <em>Disguise Self</em>.&nbsp; This effect is an
    illusion and can be changed at will by spending an action.&nbsp; Only your clothes’ and equipment’s appearance can
    change; your body cannot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When you use Another’s Flesh, you appear as a normal person without any
    necrografts, should you have any others.&nbsp; However, you may still use all of the abilities granted by your
    necrografts.&nbsp; Some, like the speed increase of Vampiric Grace, won’t appear to be unnatural, but many, like
    using the powers granted by the Bone Spikes necrograft, will clearly reveal that you are not what you appear to
    be.</p>\r\n<p>Returning to your original form takes a bonus action, while dropping an illusion of clothes and
    equipment takes no action.&nbsp; If killed, you revert to your original form.&nbsp; However, when you are in your
    altered form, you can spend an action to return to your original form in an extremely disturbing manner.&nbsp; Your
    original form appears to erupt from the flesh of your altered form.</p>\r\n<p>Any enemies that witness your Violent
    Transformation must make a Wisdom saving throw.&nbsp; If they fail, they take psychic damage equal to your
    necrografter level +10 and are frightened of you until the end of their next turn.&nbsp; Creatures that succeed take
    half damage and aren’t frightened. Once you use this feature, you can’t use again it until you finish a short or
    long rest.</p>\r\n<p>At Stage 1, you and the other soul are definitely aware of each other.&nbsp; If you didn’t
    already know, you learn their name and some broad, general details about them such as their age and where they are
    from.&nbsp; You cannot directly communicate with the soul, but might hear whispers from it once or twice a day. You
    also occasionally have dreams about their life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong></p>\r\n<p>Any
    creature that fails its saving throw against Violent Transformation is frightened for 1 minute.&nbsp; At the end of
    its turn, it can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect.</p>\r\n<p>At Stage 2, you learn more details about
    the other soul, and vice-versa.&nbsp; You roughly know the same information about them as you would a casual
    acquaintance.&nbsp; You can also communicate directly with it, although this method of communication is cumbersome
    and slow.&nbsp; Your relationship with the soul could vary wildly depending who they were and on the actions you
    take as an adventurer.&nbsp; They are under no obligation to answer any questions you ask.&nbsp; You probably have a
    dream about their life once a week.</p>\r\n<p>If the soul is that of a child, you cannot help but be subtly
    influenced by its youthful qualities.&nbsp; You gain proficiency in Performance and advantage on Deception checks to
    appear helpless or innocent.</p>\r\n<p>If the soul is that of an adult, you subconsciously learn how to perform
    certain tasks.&nbsp; You gain proficiency in any one tool or skill that the soul was proficient with.</p>\r\n<p>
    <strong>Stage 3</strong></p>\r\n<p>Creatures that are frightened by Violent Transformation take psychic damage equal
    to your Constitution modifier at the start of their turns as they are mentally scarred by your grotesque
    metamorphosis.</p>\r\n<p>You have learned enough about the other soul to persuasively imitate them. You gain
    advantage on any Charisma (Deception checks) to convince others that you are the other soul.</p>\r\n<p>At Stage 3,
    you and the other soul know as much information about each other as good friends do. You can communicate with each
    other more efficiently.&nbsp; You frequently dream about their life and they might choose to talk to you in your
    dreams.</p>\r\n<p>If the soul is that of a child, you gain the ability to wield a shard of their lost destiny.&nbsp;
    Once per long rest, you can reroll any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw and take the higher result.&nbsp;
    If the roll was made with advantage, reroll only one of the dice.</p>\r\n<p>If the soul is that of an adult, you
    gain more of their abilities.&nbsp; You gain proficiency in one language, tool, and skill they were proficient
    in.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong></p>\r\n<p>Violent Transformation now does psychic damage equal to twice your
    necrografter level.</p>\r\n<p>Any creature that fails its saving throw against Violent Transformation and is
    frightened must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The
    creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.</p>\r\n<p>At Stage 4, you and the
    other soul have almost total access to each other’s memories. You can communicate with each other as though you were
    talking face to face.&nbsp; It may choose to appear before your waking eyes.&nbsp; No one else can see it.</p>\r\n
<p>If the soul chooses, it can make you dream about it every night.</p>\r\n<p>If the soul wants to, it can prevent you
    from dying.&nbsp; Once per day, you can effectively ignore a death saving throw failure.&nbsp; Generally, only souls
    that you have a good relationship with will grant you this favor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If your relationship with the soul
    is more rocky, as is often the case, and the failed death saving throw will kill you, the GM may give you and the
    soul a chance to bargain for your life.&nbsp; This will likely require significant action on your part, if the soul
    is willing at all.&nbsp; If the soul decides to save your life in return for a request, it has the power to kill you
    if you fail to perform as requested.&nbsp; However, unless the GM decides otherwise, it cannot kill you while you
    are sincerely trying to perform the request or after you have completed the request.</p>\r\n<p>Unless the GM decides
    otherwise, if a soul saves your life without demanding a favor because it likes you, and later your relationship
    sours, it cannot kill you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Other necrografts can be found on DnDBeyond.&nbsp; Here is the

    This spell was originally designed as part of the Necrografter class, which can be found on DnDBeyond. It is
    intended to be used with the spell <em>Unhallowed Arts</em>, which can also be found on DnDBeyond.</p>\r\n<p>
    <strong>Stage 1</strong></p>\r\n<p>Your base speed increases by 10 feet when you’re not wearing heavy armor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n
<p>You grow vampire-like fangs that you can reveal and retract at will.&nbsp; This takes no action.&nbsp; You can use
    these fangs as one of your unarmed strikes once per turn.&nbsp; This attack deals piercing damage.&nbsp; It does an
    extra 1 necrotic damage and you gain temporary hit points equal to this necrotic damage as you feast on the victim’s
    blood or essence.&nbsp; Creatures that lack blood or a similar vital fluid are immune to this damage. You can feed
    on recently slain enemies to gain temporary hit points.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, you gain the Vampiric Grace ability.
    When attacked or forced to make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect for half or no damage, you can use your
    reaction to move up to your speed.&nbsp; This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.&nbsp; If done in
    response to an attack, the attack is at disadvantage.&nbsp; If forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, and your
    movement removes you from the affected area, you have advantage on the saving throw. If the GM so decides, this
    could also grant advantage on saving throws against area effects like <em>Stinking Cloud</em>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n
<p>You may instead use Vampiric Grace to dash or disengage as a bonus action or to reroll an Acrobatics check and take
    the higher result.&nbsp; If you made the check with advantage, reroll only one of the dice. You can use this feature
    three times. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong></p>\r\n
<p>You can use a bonus action to give yourself the ability to climb as if you had cast <em>Spider Climb</em> on
    yourself.&nbsp; This ability does not require concentration.&nbsp; You can do this for up to 10 minutes per day in
    increments of 1 minute, so you could activate it once for 10 minutes, or five separate times of 2 minutes each, for
    example.</p>\r\n<p>During your turn, if you hit a creature with a melee attack, that creature can't make opportunity
    attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p>\r\n<p>Your vampiric fangs now deal an additional 2 necrotic
    damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong></p>\r\n<p>You gain the Bat Form ability.&nbsp; You can magically assume
    the shape of a bat.&nbsp; This functions as the Wild Shape ability of a druid, except that you don’t assume the
    bat’s hit points and hit dice; you retain your own.&nbsp; Additionally, your bite attack deals the additional damage
    of your vampiric fangs.&nbsp; You cannot activate the abilities of any other necrografts while in the form of a bat
    save the Children of the Night ability of the Vampiric Soul necrograft. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
    again until you finish a short or long rest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Your vampiric fangs now deal an additional 3 necrotic
    damage.</p>\r\n<p>You can climb as if you had cast <em>Spider Climb</em> on yourself for up to 1 hour per day.

    damage.</p>\r\n<p>You understand that vampires are not only graceful hunters of the night, but vicious,
    ever-starving predators.&nbsp; You gain the Vampiric Frenzy ability.&nbsp; With a bonus action, you can unleash your
    undying hunger to become a relentless combatant.</p>\r\n<p>You gain the benefits of <em>Haste</em>, but you are not
    stunned once the effect ends.&nbsp; While affected, you also gain the following powers:</p>\r\n
<ul>\r\n
    <li>You gain the Evasion ability of a rogue.</li>
    \r\n
    <li>You gain the benefits of <em>Freedom of Movement</em>.</li>

</p>\r\n<p><br/> 7) <u>Dissonant Curse:</u> For the duration of the spell the cursed victim hears the speech of other
    people as incoherent nonsense.</p>\r\n<p><br/> 8) <u>Curse of Blood Weakness:</u> For the duration of the spell the

    the duration of the spell the cursed victim is struck blind as per the level 2 spell.</p>\r\n<p><br/> 10) <u>Curse

    the victim to re-roll a D20 and they have to take the lowest of the two, this is to a maximum of three rolls per
    long rest.</p>\r\n<p>11) <u>Sleep Curse:</u> For the duration of the spell the cursed victim falls asleep. The
    victim can be woken by being roughly shaken or if they take damage but will otherwise sleep through loud noises and
    commotions, Should the duration extend for 24 hours or be a permanent duration, then every time the victim sleeps
    they will remain asleep unless they are shaken awake, take damage, the spell duration ends or the curse is removed.
    Creatures immune to magical sleep or that do not sleep are immune to this effect.</p>\r\n<p>12) <u>Curse of the
    Poisoned Touch:</u> For the duration of the spell the cursed victim become deathly allergic to one item or substance
    of the casters choice. For the duration of the spell, at the start of the victims turn they takes 1d8 poison damage

    any resistance or immunity to poison or the poisoned condition for the duration of the spell.</p>\r\n<p>13) <u>Curse
    of the Poisoned Heart:</u> For the duration of the spell, whenever the cursed victim approaches within 10ft or
    starts their turn within 10ft of a particular person or object they suffer severe chest pains and take 1d8 necrotic

    and move away from the person or object.</p>\r\n<p>14) <u>Curse of the Bestial Form:</u> For the duration of the
    spell the victims form changes and takes on one aspects of a beast of the casters choosing (such as changing the
    victims head to resemble that of a cow). This is a purely cosmetic change to appearance and does not grant any
    special abilities/modes of attack/extra senses/modes of travel or forms of breathing (so although you may change
    someone's form and give them aspects of a fish they would not gain a swim speed or be able to breath underwater).
</p>\r\n<p>15) <u>Curse of Harmful Healing: </u>For the duration of the spell, whenever the cursed victim is healed they
    instead take necrotic damage equal to the amount of healing given. For example if targeted with a level 1 cure
    wounds spell they take 1d8 (+spell casting mod) Necrotic Damage instead of being healed.</p>\r\n<p>16) &nbsp;<u>Love
    Curse: </u>For the duration of the spell the cursed victim believes one person or creature of the casters choosing
    is the love of their life and they become utterly and completely consumed about keeping that person or creature
    safe. This is beyond a charm or domination, this is the worst kind of obsession. The victim follows the object of
    their love and eventually stalks them or tries to abduct them in order to keep them safe.</p>\r\n<p>17) <u>Corrupt
    Aura:</u> For the duration of the spell the cursed victims aura is corrupted by necromantic magic. The Caster can
    choose one of the following:</p>\r\n
<ol>\r\n
    <li>a) Undead Aura: If anyone uses abilities, skills or spells to detect undead the victim will appear to be
        undead.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>b) Lying Aura: If anyone uses abilities, skills or spells to detect lies then the victim appears to be lying.
    </li>
    \r\n
</ol>\r\n<p>18) <u>Crimson Rage</u>: For the duration of the spell the cursed victim is unusually angry and aggressive.
    Whenever they see blood they must make a Wisdom Saving throw (DC equal to the Casters Spell DC), on a success they
    remain angry/aggressive but can control themselves. On a failure they fly into a berserk rage, viewing <u>all</u>
    weapon wielding people/creatures as enemies to be slain and no longer recognises friend from foe. Although in a
    berserk rage, the victim is not in a barbarian rage so does not receive any damage reductions or bonus damage.
</p>\r\n<p>19) <u>Phobic Curse:</u> For the duration of the spell the cursed victim suffers from a severe and
    debilitating phobia of the casters choosing. Whenever the victim comes into contact with the source of this phobia
    they must make a Wisdom Saving throw (DC equal to the Casters Spell DC) or be affected with the Frightened condition
    and must either move away from the source of their fear as fast as possible or become catatonic and remain stock
    still.</p>\r\n<p>Example phobias are:</p>\r\n
<ol>\r\n
    <li>a) Nyctophobia or Fear of the Dark: At night or when in dark places/caverns or in magical darkness the cursed
        victim becomes catatonic and remains stock still, should light be available the cursed target tries to remain as
        close to the light source as possible.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>b) Arachnophobia or Fear of Spiders: The victim must flee as fast as possible from any spiders or spider like
        creatures.
    </li>
    \r\n
</ol>\r\n<p>20) <u>Cursed Form:</u> For the duration of the spell the victims form changes. Roll d100 and consult the
    table in the reincarnation spell to determine what race the new form changes to. No special abilities or Stat
    increases are gained this is just a cosmetic change of appearance.</p>\r\n<p>21) <u>Animating Curse:</u> Using the
    curse in this way raises the casting time to 10 minutes and it is cast as a ritual and does not use a spell slot but
    requires 300gp of additional ritual components such as herbs, incense, blood and engraved bones which are consumed
    by the spell. The caster places a curse to create one of the following effects &amp; creatures created via this
    curse remain animated until they are destroyed or subjected to a remove curse or dispel magic spell. The Animation
    lasts for the duration of the spell.</p>\r\n
<ol>\r\n
    <li>a) Animated Armour: If the curse is cast on a suit of armour in a site where some one has died the caster can
        bind a splinter of a soul from one of the fallen into the armour and animate it as per the Animated Armour
        construct (see the Monster Manual). It takes the casters bonus action to command the animated armour. The armour
        must be mundane and you cannot animated magical armour.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>b) Flying Weapon: If the curse is cast on a weapon in a site where some one has died the caster can bind a
        splinter of a soul from one of the fallen into the weapon and animate it as per the Flying Sword construct (see
        the Monster Manual). It takes the casters bonus action to command the Flying Weapon. The weapon must be a normal
        mundane weapon and you cannot animate magical weapons. If you hold onto the weapon and try to fly with it then
        you need to succeed on Strength check to maintain your grasp and the weapons speed is reduced by 50%.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>c) Cursed Rug: If the curse is cast on a rug in a site where some one has died the caster can bind a splinter of
        a soul from one of the fallen into the rug and animate it as per the Rug of Smothering construct (see the
        Monster Manual). It takes the casters bonus action to command the Rug of Smothering. The rug must be mundane and
        you cannot animate a magical rug. The Rug you are cursing must also be worth at least 100gp.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>d) Animated Scarecrow: If the curse is cast on a mundane scarecrow in a site where some one has died the caster
        can bind a splinter of a soul from one of the fallen into the scarecrow and animate it as per the Scarecrow
        construct (see the Monster Manual). It takes the casters bonus action to command the Scarecrow.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>e) Animate Cursed Stone: If the curse is cast on someone who has been petrified, the caster can bind a splinter
        of the petrified soul and animate the petrified statue as per the Stone Cursed construct (see Mordenkainens Tome
        of Foes). It takes the casters bonus action to command the Stone Cursed.
    </li>
    \r\n
</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;22) <u>Cursed Sight:</u> For the duration of the spell the victim becomes convinced they can see
    invisible creatures moving and constantly flickering in and out of reality in their peripheral vision and becomes
    filled with dread that the shadows are waiting to jump out and stab them in the back. The victim suffers
    disadvantage on all concentration, investigation and perception checks due to the constant paranoia of seeing the
    shadows move.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;23) <u>Blood Thirst:&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;For the duration of the spell the victim needs the
    flesh and blood of sentient creatures in order to survive. Whenever they eat normal food or drink normal drinks they
    gain no benefit from doing so and the taste of normal food and drink is rancid to them, only the flesh and blood of
    sentient creatures will satisfy them.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;24) <u>Life Unending:</u> For the duration of the spell, the
    cursed victim becomes functionally immortal, meaning they won't die from old age. However, they still age, they can
    still be poisoned, suffer diseases and illnesses and be injured by spells, weapons and accidents and be killed. If
    the victim does die, either by taking their own life or suffering a fatal accident or through general misadventure,
    then their soul remains trapped/bound to their remains forever but sometimes victims of particularly strong will can
    manifest as a poltergeist or ghost. This type of curse is often used as a punishment by Hags, forcing the victim to
    grow older and older and know that even death will not end their suffering. Should someone try to restore the victim
    to life the spell automatically fails unless the remains have a remove curse spell cast on them first.</p>\r\n<p>(DM
    Note, This one is manly a plot device for 9th level curses and this may not sound like much but think about it this
    way, if a human is cursed with this and hangs around to be 700 years old, they are not preternaturally youthful or
    graceful like an elf, they are a 700 year old human, they look ancient and wizened, their bones are fragile, their
    muscles wasted, every movement agony and likely suffering from some form of dementia and even death offers no
    respite).</p>\r\n<p>25) &nbsp;<u>Ritual Curse:</u> The Caster can imbue one object or a piece of food or liquid with
    one of the curses above and can name a particular person it will affect. The effect of the curse comes into affect
    when the named individual other than the caster touches the object or eats the food or drinks the liquid. This curse
    can enchant an item or object at most dagger sized or an item of food no larger than an apple or liquid upto 1 pint.&nbsp;
    Using bestow curse in this way raises the casting time to 10 minutes and, regardless of the spell slot used to cast
    the spell, the caster must maintain concentration on the curse until the object is touched/food or drink is
    consumed. Once the object is touched/food is consumed the curse lasts for the remaining duration of the spell.
</p>\r\n<p>(DM note: think the poisoned apple in snow white for how this is used)</p>\r\n<p><strong>At Higher
    Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up
    to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of
    7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is
    dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn't require concentration.

    of Tiny Hut for those whose&nbsp;background or faith includes the idea of wards to protect your allies and/or
    frustrate your enemies. It is also more detailed and specific in its effects.</p>\r\n<p>As the final part of the
    spell is cast, a shimmering bubble of force expands out from the caster until it has reached either the maximum
    distance as specified by the caster or 10', whichever is smaller.&nbsp; The minimum size it can be cast at is a 5'
    radius. It will pass thru anything inside its radius until it reaches its intended size at which point it solidifies
    into an up to a 10-foot-radius ellipsoidal dome of force locked to the surface under it with a 1\" flat surface of
    force that those inside will find themselves standing or sitting on.&nbsp; Soft surfaces such as dirt will be
    pressed down if possible. Once successfully cast, the&nbsp;dome will remain stationary, relative to the surface for
    the duration, locked to a circular pattern of softly glowing runes around the inside border. Thus a dome cast on the
    surface of a large ship would move with it, but if cast on a rowboat, it would fail as the surface for it isn't
    large enough.</p>\r\n<p>The spell fails if:</p>\r\n
<ul>\r\n
    <li>The area at time of casting includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures of small size or above. So a
        swarm of bats won't cause the spell to fail, but 5 mages with 5 donkeys will.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>The dome is too large for the area it is cast into . Thus a 5' radius dome could fit into a 10x10 room, but a
        10' radius dome couldn't and would fail if cast.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>The creatures and objects inside at casting are positioned such that more than 100 lbs of force would be
        required to move them totally inside the dome. Thus an 8' tall ogre standing next to the caster would be fine,
        but if the same ogre was at the border of the spell and resisted being pushed inside by the spell during its
        final phase, it would fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    \r\n
</ul>\r\n<p>Once successfully cast:</p>\r\n
<ul>\r\n
    <li>A vertical cross section of the dome is an ellipse specified by the caster ranging from a quarter sphere (height
        = 1/2 radius) to a hemisphere (height = radius) to an elongated dome (height = diameter).&nbsp;
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>Up to nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you, although if the dome is too
        small this number may be reduced by the GM. Tiny creatures which are not magically bonded or magical in
        themselves, like a swarm of bats or insects, don't count against this limit. But familiars and pixies, for
        example, would. A non magical pet bird like a canary, however, would not.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures
        and objects are barred from passing through it.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>Spells and other magical effects can't extend through the dome or be cast through it. However magical items such
        as armor and swords, which were inside at the time of casting can pass thru it if carried by one of the people
        allowed to pass.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>Spells can be cast inside the dome, but their effects will not pass thru it. Thus if the caster's familiar
        leaves the dome, telepathic communication to it is blocked by the dome while it is outside since that is a
        magical effect. Similarly an echo knight's echo can not pass thru the dome.&nbsp;
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>Items not carried by a person inside the dome will not pass thru it. So you can't shoot arrows or toss rocks out
        of the dome, but you can step outside carrying them and then shoot them.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>Non magical small objects such as coins, gems, buckets of water, wine bottles, rocks or arrows picked up outside
        by those allowed to pass may be carried inside. Large objects, magical items, spell books, scrolls and the like
        which were not inside at casting may not and will bounce off the outer shell of the dome if someone tries it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable, breathable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Thus rain
        and clouds of magical gas will not pass thru it.&nbsp;
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark.</li>
    \r\n
    <li>The dome is usually opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside. It
        may be made almost transparent from the outside, but a DC 10 perception roll will spot the tell-tale shimmer.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>As the dome has a floor, tunneling creatures may not bypass its defenses by coming thru it.&nbsp;</li>
    \r\n
</ul>\r\n<p>The dome may be destroyed as follows:</p>\r\n
<ul>\r\n
    <li>The caster leaves its area</li>
    \r\n
    <li>Time expires.</li>
    \r\n
    <li>A dispel magic cast at a level equal or higher than the dome will bring it down. This if the dome was cast using
        a 5th level slot, then a dispel magic would also need to be cast using a slot of 5th level or above to bring it
        down.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>Disintegrate ray or spell</li>
    \r\n
    <li>Anti-magic spell.</li>
    \r\n
    <li>Limited wish, wish or equivalent spell or ability</li>
    \r\n
    <li>Ironically a sphere of annihilation will not pass thru it or destroy it, but merely roll around its perimeter
        making this one of the few defenses against such. Note, however that no one in the dome can attempt to control
        such a sphere.

    antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the
    sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell
    ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p>\r\n<p>Spells and other magical effects, except those created
    by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a
    suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed
    counts against its duration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong> Spells and other magical effects, such as
    <strong>magic missile</strong> and <strong>charm person</strong>, that target a creature or an object in the sphere
    have no effect on that target.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Areas of Magic.</strong> The area of another spell or magical
    effect, such as <strong>fireball</strong>, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic,
    the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a <strong>wall
        of fire</strong> are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.
</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spells.</strong> Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is
    suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The properties and powers
    of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a <strong>longsword, +1</strong>&nbsp;in the sphere
    functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p>\r\n<p>A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used
    against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic
    ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target
    outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Magical
    Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination
    or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well
    as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the <strong>rope trick</strong> spell,
    temporarily closes while in the sphere.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong> A creature or object
    summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears
    once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dispel Magic.</strong> Spells

    <strong>Burial.</strong> The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just
    large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar
    travel to get into or out of it.</p>\r\n<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral
    orb.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Chaining.</strong> Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The
    target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.</p>\r\n<p>The
    special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hedged
    Prison.</strong> The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and
    planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your
    choice.</p>\r\n<p>The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison
    made from jade.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Minimus Containment.</strong> The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is
    imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to
    see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar
    travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.</p>\r\n<p>The special component for
    this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Slumber.</strong>
    The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare
    soporific herbs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ending the Spell.</strong> During the casting of the spell, in any of its
    versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be
    as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a
    likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise
    must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.
</p>\r\n<p>A magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the
    special component used to create it.</p>\r\n<p>You can use a particular special component to create only one prison
    at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately
    freed from its binding.</p>","sourceId":1},{"id":2155,"label":"Incendiary Cloud","description":"<p>A swirling cloud

    circle whose sigil sequence you know. \"Associated object\" means that you possess an object taken from the desired
    destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a
    chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.</p>\r\n<p>\"Very familiar\" is a place you have been very often, a place
    you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \"Seen casually\" is someplace you have
    seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place you have seen once, possibly
    using magic. \"Description\" is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else's description,
    perhaps from a map.</p>\r\n<p>\"False destination\" is a place that doesn't exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an
    enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no
    longer exists.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want
    to.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Off Target.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away
    from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 &times; 1d10 percent of the distance that
    was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the
    two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target
    randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the
    compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.
</p>\r\n<p><strong>Similar Area.</strong> You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's
    visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you
    might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and
    implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range
    limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mishap.</strong> The spell's
    unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10
    force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage
    each time).</p>","sourceId":1},{"id":2276,"label":"Teleportation Circle","description":"<p>As you cast the spell,

    of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors

    creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name
    when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM’s
    choice).</p>\r\n<p>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it

    Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an
    allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange
    their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p>\r\n<p>A task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment
    worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10
    days) requires 10,000 GP per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast
    the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.
    Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require
    a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p>\r\n<p>After the creature completes the task,
    or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to

        you can see when you cast the spell.

    <li>&ldquo;Seen casually&rdquo; is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>&ldquo;Viewed once or described&rdquo; is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you know
        through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.
    </li>
    \r\n
    <li>&ldquo;False destination&rdquo; is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but
        instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.

    likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in
    part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing
    that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive,
    effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly
    transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences
    for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god,
    the god’s divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a

        </li>
        \r\n
        <li><strong>Detect Magic</strong> is quintupled as it essentially gives a new ability to a base action (Search).
        </li>
        \r\n
        <li><strong>Enhance Ability</strong>&nbsp;is 50% more, as&nbsp;it gives you advantage on all associated Skill

        </li>
        \r\n
        <li><strong>Enlarge/Reduce</strong>&nbsp;is doubled because it increases a base stat (Size), and directly

        </li>
        \r\n
        <li><strong>Longstrider</strong>&nbsp;is quintupled as&nbsp;it increases a base stat (Speed) which can strongly

        <li><strong>Wall of Sand</strong>, <strong>Wall of Water</strong>, and <strong>Wind Wall</strong> are all 25%

<hr/>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;Note to Dungeon Masters.</h4>\r\n
<div class=\"spoiler\">\r\n<p>Be&nbsp;aware that permanency can alter/disrupt a campaign's entire direction, as the
    party instead buckles down to make a fortress, or chooses to lay siege to an enemy rather than go forth and knock
    down the door. Nonetheless, I feel this spell is&nbsp;a worthwhile addition to a Wizards' arsenal, and deserves a
    place in at least a few wizards spellbooks, be it to build a fortress, or become an all-knowing Archmage.</p>\r\n<p>
    &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some spells that might deserve to be on this list (but aren't for various reasons) are simply swept
    aside due to not fitting my vision of the spell, as I planned Permanency to fit (mostly) a Augmentation, Building,
    and Utility role. Furthermore, I discourage allowing spells of 6th level or higher from being made available for use
    with this enhancement (with the exception below), due to Augmentation and Utility spells becoming abruptly more
    powerful after 5th level.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Nonetheless, the most honourable mention for said excluded
    spells would be&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magnificent-mansion\" target=\"_blank\">Magnificent
        Mansion</a></strong>&nbsp;the 7th Level spell, (estimated 125'000 GP)&nbsp;which is a truly amazing spell that
    creates a wonderful hideaway in an extra dimensional space. The Mansion presents no outward problems, as it may be
    completely impregnable, it is also completely immovable, thus implementing it would be fine; It could be an
    adventure in and of itself to give the wizard enough Gold to cast such an amazing spell.</p>\r\n

    freestanding lava inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the
    following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a
    different one.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Flood.</strong> You cause the lava level of all standing lava in the area to rise
    by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding lava spills over onto dry land.</p>\r\n<p>If you
    choose an area in a large body of lava, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the
    area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the
    other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.</p>\r\n<p>The
    lava level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave,
    the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.</p>\r\n<p>
    <strong>Eruption.&nbsp;</strong>You may cause a 10-foot wide, 20-foot tall pillar of lava to erupt out of the ground
    at a location of choice. If a creature is located with 10 feet of the pillar, it must make a Dexterity saving throw
    against your spell save DC or take 3d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 fire damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Part Lava.</strong>
    You cause Lava in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the
    separated lava forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different
    effect. The lava then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal lava level is
    restored.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Redirect Flow.</strong> You cause flowing lava in the area to move in a direction you
    choose, even if the lava has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The lava in the area
    moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain
    conditions. The lava continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different
    effect.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Whirlpool.</strong> This effect requires a body of lava at least 50 feet square and 25
    feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide
    at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the lava and within 25 feet
    of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics)
    check against your spell save DC.</p>\r\n<p>When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts
    its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage
    and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't
    caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as
    described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.</p>\r\n<p>The first time each turn
    that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains
    in the vortex.</p>","sourceId":null},{"id":7930,"label":"Arcane Anchor","description":"<p>Choose a humanoid that you

                                              ability without using clerical powers. Time is of the essence when using
                                              this spell, though, as the farther into the past the body is to be pushed,
                                              the greater the chance of failure. The caster is able to unerringly push
                                              the body back one minute in time for every level. For example, a 9th-level
                                              caster is guaranteed to restore a person to the state of helath its body
                                              was in up to nine minutes ago. For every additional minute that the caster
                                              attempts to push the body backward in time, there is a cumulative 5%
                                              chance of failure. If the 9th-level caster tried to use this spell to heal
                                              a warrior wounded just under 20 minutes before the spell was cast, that
                                              would be 11 minutes further than he could guarantee success, so the spell
                                              would have a 55% chance of failing. Multiple Timeheals cannot be cast to
                                              increase number of minutes that the caster can guarantee pushing the body
                                              backward in time. The 9th-level wizard cannot cast three consecutive
                                              Timeheals to roll the patient back 27 minutes in time. This is because the
                                              caster is actually bringing the patient's past body into the present with
    each casting. Each time the spell goes back only nine minutes, and it brings back the same nine-minute-old version
    of the body. Timeheal cannot recall a spirit from death (unless DM rules it has not yet departed, within a single
    round, within the last few seconds, for example) and therefore is only useful on a still-living character. A dead
    body that has Timeheal cast on it may be entirely healed, but it remains dead, as the body's spirit has fled. If the
    spirit can somehow be reunited with the body, though (say through Raise Dead), the patient will then be alive and as
    well as the Timeheal can make him. Timeheal can also be used to hurt an opponent that has recently healed itself. In
    this case, the caster must successfully touch the target (with an attack roll), and the target gets a Wis save. Any
    healing (or damage) done to the target since the moment that the body is being rolled back to is negated, but all
    the damage the body had at that point is immediately reapplied. The resources used to heal the target are entirely
    wasted. The standard chances of failure still apply.&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:14720,&quot;10&quot;:0,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,0],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}\">Multiple

    Permanency might become unstable or fail after very long periods of activity, such as having been in effect for at
    least 1,000 years. Unstable effects might operate intermittently, produce strange or unexpected side effects, or
    simply fail altogether. The DM may determine that certain spells cannot be made permanent with this spell, or that
    specific spells must be further researched before Permanency can be used on them by a player. In this case,
    researching the special case application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the
    target spell itself. If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research
    automatically fails. Note that the wizard never learns what is possible except by the success or failure of their

    Pick a target creature within 60' (or self) : There are now <em>two</em> of the target creature, for the next

</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Full Description:</span><br/><em>There are now two of the
    target creature, for the next minute...</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em> This dangerous spell causes a single target
    creature in range that the caster can see&nbsp;to begin to exist in two mutually exclusive states of probability,
    causing the target's lifeline to fork temporarily.&nbsp; For the next minute, that creature exists in two places at
    once, each instance of it acting according to their own subjective perspective and circumstance, until reality is
    able to correct the anomaly.&nbsp; Each instance of the target creature has all of their
    <strong>non-magical</strong> (see <strong>At Higher Levels</strong> for&nbsp;magic items effected with higher level
    slots) equipment and items, their unspent spell slots, and unused abilities.&nbsp; Any magical items that were not
    bifurcated are evenly divided between the two creature instances as their controller sees fit, but must be decided
    upon immediately as the spell is cast.&nbsp; Each instance of the target creature may use any or all of their
    independent resources, without effecting the quantity of the other instance.&nbsp; Keep track of consumables,
    charges, spells, and abilities used separately for each instance of the target creature.&nbsp; This is essentially
    like having a twin of the target creature for the duration of the spell, as well as a&nbsp;second piece of every
    affected item they were carrying when the spell was cast.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Control:</strong><br/>Both instances of
    the target creature&nbsp;share all initiatives, and are both controlled by the original character's owner (DM if
    NPC, Player if PC, etc), though the group may decide to allow two people to separately control each instance, with
    the owner's explicit permission, if it would simplify things or enhance fun.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spell
    End:</strong><br/><em><strong>One random copy, and all gear they&nbsp;started with&nbsp;vanishes; the other remains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only
    spells/charges/abilities the remaining copy used&nbsp;were&nbsp;spent...</strong></em>&nbsp; At the end of this
    spell's duration, one of the two instances is chosen <strong>at random.</strong>&nbsp; The selected instance and all
    their original bifurcated gear (regardless of who currently holds it)&nbsp;vanishes, and only the other instance now
    remains.&nbsp; Only&nbsp;item charges, spells, abilities, consumables, damage, healing, status effects, afflictions,
    etc that the remaining creature has used or is suffering now apply.&nbsp; <em>(It may be helpful to refer to the
        copies as \"Heads\" and \"Tails\", \"Evens\" and \"Odds\", \"High\" and \"Low\", etc as soon as the spell is
        cast, to help track which copy vanishes when the spell ends.)</em></p>\r\n<p>This spell ends prematurely if
    either of the creature instances is slain, destroyed, petrified, imprisoned (via the spell Imprisonment), or
    afflicted by any other similar character-ending effect.&nbsp; If this happens, immediately select one of the two
    creature instances at random, as you normally would.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the&nbsp;afflicted&nbsp;instance ends up being
    the one that remains, the creature is now suffering the affliction.</p>\r\n<p>This spell also ends immediately if
    anyone casts Lifeline Bifurcation on a creature already affected by this spell.</p>\r\n<p>Any non-bifurcated items
    that the vanished instance might have picked up or been given during the duration of the spell are left on the
    ground where they vanished.&nbsp; Any duplicated items dropped or given to another character by the vanished
    instance before the spell ended vanish along with the creature.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Risks:</strong><br/><em><strong>A
    base 30% chance that hostile creatures from the demiplane of time are summoned...</strong></em>&nbsp; Casting this
    spell is a severe violation of the natural order of temporal mechanics, and essentially creates a short-lived, but
    very real paradox.&nbsp; Much of the magic power of this spell is, in fact, spent simply containing this paradox so
    that it doesn't damage reality.&nbsp; Large amounts of turbulence are created in the time-stream of the demiplane of
    time.&nbsp; There is a 30% chance that this attracts the attention of some inhabitants of that demiplane.</p>\r\n<p>
    <em><strong>A Base 10% chance of&nbsp;Temporal Storm for each powerful item duplicated...</strong></em>&nbsp;
    Additionally, powerful or important items that get bifurcated by this spell carry a risk of inflating this
    paradoxical event to the point that it exceeds the spell's constraints and damages the fabric of reality.&nbsp; The
    DM decides what items are famous, historically influential, or powerful enough to be considered \"troublesome\"&nbsp;should
    two instances of them exist simultaneously.&nbsp; For each \"troublesome\" item bifurcated in this way, there is a
    cumulative 10% chance that a hole is torn in reality.&nbsp; If this should happen, a massive Temporal Storm of
    tornadoes and mist-smoke will form, immediately pulling the caster, the target creature, and any living creatures
    within 100 feet of them out of reality, leaving them stranded in the demiplane of time.&nbsp; Artifacts (allowed at
    higher level castings) are automatically considered \"troublesome\", unless the DM rules otherwise (such as&nbsp;might
    be&nbsp;the case&nbsp;for certain Chronomancer Artifacts).&nbsp; Roll this probability as the spell is cast.</p>\r\n
<p><strong><em>A Wisdom save vs base DC 15, or suffers Disadvantage on all rolls for 1d6 days...</em>&nbsp;</strong>
    Finally, when this spell ends, the target must make a Wisdom save to avoid long term scarring to their lifeline.&nbsp;
    On a failed save, the target's fate is damaged, and as a result, they suffer Disadvantage on all rolls they make for
    the next 1d6 days.&nbsp; This rotten run of luck due to damaged fate can be repaired at any time by spending all
    charges of the Lucky feat, by having Greater Restoration, Wish, or a similar restorative or reality-altering spell
    cast, or by spending an Inspiration token.&nbsp; Otherwise, the damage mends itself naturally after the 1d6 days
    have elapsed.&nbsp; Note: any character may spend their Lucky charges or use their&nbsp;Inspiration to heal another
    character's damaged fate.&nbsp; The base DC for this save is 15.</p>\r\n<p>The spell component is a tiny silver
    pitcher with two spouts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels:<br/>5th level slot</strong> - Common magic items on

    least 1 minute, such as the magic weapon spell.&nbsp;Doing so allows you to attempt to strengthen the bindings of
    the magic affecting the object. If you are successful, the original spell's duration increases to&nbsp;8 hours&nbsp;and
    if that spell previously required its caster's concentration, it no longer does.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The type of objects
    you can transmogrify with this spell has some restrictions. The object can be&nbsp;no larger than 5ft in any
    dimension.&nbsp;Alternatively, you can&nbsp;transmogrify up to 20 pieces of ammunition affected by the same spell.
    If it is a magic object or wondrous items, the spell becomes more complicated, which is explained below. If&nbsp;you
    attempt to cast this spell on a&nbsp;object with a qualifying effect that would fade before&nbsp;you finish casting
    this spell, its duration is extended at least until you finish casting this spell.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, you can
    cast this spell on an object conjured or created with magic, providing it has the appropriate minimum duration, it
    has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores, is not alive, and meets the other normal requirements of this
    spell. The conjured object cannot be used or wielded while you cast this spell. If the magic conjuring or creating
    the object requires it to remain in contact with its conjurer or creator, that&nbsp;creature must do so for the
    duration of your casting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To perform the transmogrification, you must supply material components
    which correspond to the magical effect you are targeting.&nbsp;The cost of the materials is based on the power and
    complexity of the spell. You can transmogrify an object conjured or affected by a spell of 1st level or higher by
    providing 75gp worth of materials per spell level. If the&nbsp;target spell was cast at a higher level, you must
    provide material components&nbsp;according to the level at which it was cast.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The type of material
    components you must provide for the spell changes according to the nature of the spell. For magics of
    the&nbsp;<strong>Evocation</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Enchantment</strong> schools, you can provide rubies, opals,
    fine quartz, or other similarly hued gems. For spells from the <strong>Abjuration</strong> or
    <strong>Divination</strong> schools of magic, you must provide pearls, clear crystals, or fine silver of appropriate
    value. For spells from the <strong>Transmutation</strong> or <strong>Illusion</strong> schools of magic, you may
    provide&nbsp;any fine material of appropriate value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Objects made of exquisite materials&nbsp;more
    readily accept the power of such spells and can retain them more easily.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Unblessed or otherwise
    mundane wood, lead, iron, steel, or stone: DC 15<br/>Objects ritually blessed or prepared for permanent enchantment,
    or an object of great significance to the creature who cast the original spell: DC 14<br/>An object made wholly or
    partially of gold, silver, or electrum: DC 13<br/>An object made wholly or partially&nbsp;of platinum, mithril, or&nbsp;adamantine:
    DC 12</p>\r\n<p>When you finish casting this spell, you make a spellcasting ability check.&nbsp;You may apply any
    proficiency you have with Arcana, tinker's tools, jeweler's tools, or smith's tools. On a success, the magic is
    bound into the item for the duration of the spell.&nbsp;The magic cannot be dispelled by spells such as dispel
    magic. If the object enters an area that nullifies the effects of magic items, such as an antimagic field, it
    functions as a normal magical item would.</p>\r\n<p>If the object is a wondrous or magic item already, you must make
    a Charisma saving throw as you alter the essence of a powerful magic object. The saving throw's DC is based on the
    object's rarity. An uncommon or common item requires a DC of 13. Rare items require a DC of 15, very rare items have
    a DC of 20. You cannot modify legendary items or artifacts with this spell. If your saving throw is successful, you
    need not make the spellcasting ability check as you weave the new magic into the existing properties of the item.
    <br/><br/>If you fail you ability check or saving throw, the spell slot is wasted, any effect you were attempting to
    make permanent is removed, and the provided materials are destroyed.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Weapons, armor, or ammunition
    you successfully transmogrify are considered&nbsp;magical for the purposes of overcoming&nbsp;resistance to
    nonmagical weapon damage for the duration or ignoring effects that target nonmagical objects. The effect lasts for
    the duration of the spell or until you cast this spell again. If you do, the effect fades from the original object
    and&nbsp;you transmogrify the new object.<br/><br/><em><strong>At higher levels:&nbsp;</strong></em>When you cast
    this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can extend the duration of the transmogrification to 24
    hours or until you cast this spell again. You can make the effect permanent by casting the spell on the same object
    every day for 1 year and 1 day. To do so, you must cast the spell on the same object before it ends as though
    targeting a 7th level transmutation effect, providing the appropriate&nbsp;material components. Expending a spell
    slot of 8th level counts as 30 days worth of casting. Expending a spell slot of 9th level this way counts as 120
    days worth of casting.</p>","sourceId":null},{"id":109684,"label":"Miasmic Breath","description":"<p>You inhale a

    and at the start of each of your turns your cells regenerate rapidly, you recover 10 hit points.</p>\r\n<p><b>Elemental
    Affinity.</b> You appearance takes on qualities of a particular element you choose. You can choose between fire,
    ice, lightning, poison, water, or earth. You decide how these characteristics affect your appearance. If the element
    you choose has a damage associated with it, than when a creature makes a melee weapon attack against you, they take
    2d6 damage of the relevant type. Additionally, you can choose whether you have resistance to the relevant damage
    type, or whether your weapon attacks (Including ranged) deal an extra 3d6 damage of that type. In the case you
    choose water, you gain resistance to piercing damage and become invisible when fully submerged in water. In the case
    you choose earth, you gain +1 AC and have resistance to slashing damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wings.</strong> You grow
    wings. Their composition is up to you (leathery, feathery, or some other kind of living material). While you have
    these wings, you gain a flight speed of 50' and can use a bonus action to bludgeon foes with them, using your spell
    attack and dealing 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Superior Enlarge.</strong>&nbsp;You grow&nbsp;up
    to two size categories. You can grow a maximum of four times your size and sixteen times your weight. When you grow
    a single category, your weapons deal 1d4 extra damage. If you grow two categories instead you deal 2d6 extra damage,
    and have -1 to your AC.&nbsp;Additionally, until this spell ends you have advantage on Strength saves and Strength
    checks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Superior Reduce.</strong>&nbsp;You shrink up to two size categories. You can instead
    shrink to a quarter your size and a sixteenth your weight. When you shrink one category, your weapons deal 1d4 less
    damage (this can't reduce the damage to below 0). If you decrease your size two categories, your weapons deal 1
    damage, plus the appropriate modifier, and you gain 1 AC. Additionally, you have disadvantage on Strength saves and
    Strength checks.</p>\r\n<p>You can also choose to instead adapt a singular particular trait of a monster you've
    seen, such as a Fire Elemental's <em>Fire Form</em>&nbsp;trait, or a Barbed Devil's <em>Devil's Sight</em>. That&nbsp;trait
    can't be of from a construct, ooze, or undead, and must be from a creature of challenge rating 7 or less. In some
    cases, your DM might restrict a trait he feels is outside the scope of this spell.

    leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will.</p>\r\n<p>At the

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you complete this ritual, several medium creatures, between 1 and
    5, appear within 10 feet of you. You can only summon small, medium or large creatures with this spell. These
    creatures are spirits that assumes the form of a creature of your choice so long as you have seen it and it is of
    your CR or below. The creature has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your
    choice) in addition to its normal type. Additionally, if the creature has an Intelligence less than 10, its
    Intelligence becomes 10, and it gains the ability to understand and speak one language of your choice that you
    speak.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the creatures created by this spell appear the spirits that they are
    formed from become the form determined by the caster. These spirits become living entities with their own thoughts,
    feeling, and even their own, newly created, souls.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the created creature’s
    appearance can be in part determined by the caster. You decide what the creature will look like, including height,
    weight, facial features, sound of their voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.
    If the creature being created is bipedal, you can't use this spell to make them quadrupedal, and vice versa. You
    cannot use this spell to create undead and most forms of constructs, excluding warforged. You may choose to have the
    creatures created be wearing mundane clothes with an appearance of your choice upon their creation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You may bestow abilities upon these creature that they wouldn’t otherwise have. For example, you humans with troll’s
    regeneration, or the ability to breath underwater. However, in order to do this, you require a piece of a creature
    that had that ability at the time the piece was taken, that material must be fresh. Casting gentle repose on a fresh
    material, to keep it fresh, works for the purposes of this spell.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The created
    creatures regard you, the caster, as a trusted friend. These creatures are inclined to accompany the caster to
    almost any place. However, these creatures do have a sense of self preservation, and will not actively comply with
    any action they decide could be a danger to their life. For example, they will not willingly walk off a cliff, go to
    certain planes of existence, or otherwise endanger their own life within reason. Each created creature can attack
    and will defend themselves, if able. Each creature can perform any task a normal human could perform, if their form
    allows for it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For every creature that is made by this spell the material cost of
    this spell is increased. 1 creature 1 platinum coin, 2 creatures 2 platinum coins, three creatures 4 platinum coins,
    and so on. The cost of this spell is also affected by the size of the creature, no bigger than large.</p>\r\n<p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creatures of medium size and below have the same material cost, but the cost is doubled for
    creatures of size large. You may even make creatures that are normally of a smaller size bigger, up to large. This
    also works in reverse to some degree. For example, large creatures can be made medium this way. You can create a
    creature that would normally be huge by reducing its size. Changes in any of the created creatures’ size cannot be
    greater than two size categories greater or less than what their &ldquo;normal form&rdquo; would be. Normal form is
    defined as the average size of the race they appear to be, if they appear to be of any known race.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Size is set as part of the ritual before the creatures have been created. Increasing or decreasing a creature’s size
    when creating them with this spell can affect how many creatures you can create with this spell. The base limit for
    the number of creatures you can create with a single casting of this spell is five. Medium creatures take one slot,
    small creatures take &frac12; of one slot, large creatures require 2 slots, and so on. For example, if you only make
    small creature the max you can summon is 10. The more you reduce the size of the creatures the more of them you can
    make.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may bestow up to 5 levels of experience to each creature you create,
    however, the source of that experience is you, you must sacrifice your own experience in order to empower your
    creations. If you wish to give your creations class levels, you must source the experience from a sufficiently
    powerful being of that class. (You must have the caster touch someone of that class.) The creature with the class
    levels that is losing their experience must be willing for the spell to have an effect.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When created each creature can gain experience of their own. Each creature gains an alignment of the caster’s
    choice, but their starting alignment must always be in part neutral. Therefore, the creature created can be true
    neutral, chaotic neutral, neutral good, and so on. The creatures created by this spell have the same requirements to
    live as the creature whose form they are given, the need to eat, to breath be it water or air, and so on. They can
    learn new things as well.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have an instinctive bond with your created
    creatures that allows you to fight as a seamless team. While within 100 feet of any of your creatures created by
    this spell, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target you’re the creatures created by this
    spell. While your creatures are within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with them telepathically.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When the created creature drops to 0 Hit Points, the creature disappears, leaving behind no trace. If the caster has
    an orb of crystal worth between 100-500 GP on their person, or in an extra-dimensional storage space that is on
    their person, when a creature the caster created with this spell dies the spirit flows into that crystal. If
    multiple of the caster’s creatures, created by this spell, die the spirits all flow into the same crystal, each
    crystal can hold one spirit for every 100 GP the crystal orb is worth. You may use this orb multiple times, should
    you choose to summon the spirits one at a time, you may also choose to increase the creatures level when re
    summoning them, the maximum level any creature created by this spell can be created as or brought up to is level
    5.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Casting this spell again can re summon a creature previously created by this
    spell from the same caster. To do so requires the soul of the created creature. Upon its re summoning it appears
    within 10 feet of the caster at full health.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may choose to summon new
    creatures instead of changing a previously created creature. However, using the orb containing the soul of a dead
    creature created by this spell will always result in that creature being revived.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    You may choose to change the level of a creature that is being revived via this spell. You may reduce that
    creatures’ level to zero, however you may not increase its level to more than 5. When reducing the level of a
    creature during the process of reviving it via this spell the caster must have a place to store those levels the
    creature is losing. This experience can be transferred to another creature that the caster is touching or can be
    given to a new creature being created alongside the creature being revived.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
    may use the orb as part of a resurrection spell in order to bring back the creature. However, if this is done the
    creature is no longer bound to you and is free to be its own person. If the creature dies after being resurrected,
    not by use of this spell, that creature’s soul departs for the afterlife. This creature can be raised from the dead
    as normal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you the caster dies, all creature you have created by this spell
    are set free.</p>\r\n<p>After casting this spell, you gain 5 levels of exhaustion. You decide whether to give class
    levels to any of the creatures you summon with this spell.</p>\r\n<p>

    worth 100gp, you can store this spell to be used as an action when not in combat (which also keeps the spirit of
    your familiar within it until released). Therefore not using any of the duration given for a familiar change such as
    changing your familiar for only four hours just to have 2 of them wasted looking for something.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>You
    gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes a creature form you choose that is up to a max size of medium
    and at the DM's discretion. The duration that the creature is in that particular form depends on the DM's discretion
    as well, but a general idea of it is provided below. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has
    the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>\r\n
<p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative
    and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\r\n<p>When the
    familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this
    spell again.</p>\r\n<p>While your familiar is within 200 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.
    Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your
    next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and
    blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r\n<p>As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It
    disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an
    action, while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of
    you.</p>\r\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a
    familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar
    transforms into the chosen creature.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar
    can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its
    reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier
    for the roll.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Durations of each type of creature are

The blessing and approval of at least one God for your journey must be secured for the spell to work. Once the casting time is finished, you touch the edge of the circle, the material components are instantly consumed, and you unleash an unimaginable amount of magical energy into the cylinder, which teleports those inside, and the air around them, to a time of your choosing (you can be in the circle as well). A thin slice of the floor will be transported, but not the sigils. A </span><span
    class=\"s2\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><b>Thunderwave</b></span><span class=\"s1\"> blast will be followed by a strong suction wind as air rushes in to fill the vacuum. The destination time can be no further than 5,000 years into the future or past. The physical location of arrival can be anywhere you decide in the material plane. The time travellers will instantaneously be transported, and will only notice a flash of light and a sudden change of scenery. At the destination, strong winds will erupt away from the time travellers as they appear and air is displaced. If the destination area is occupied, the cylinder will be moved to the closest available free space. Casting the spell is an ordeal, and has a 50% chance of instantly killing and disintegrating the caster. If multiple mages assist in the casting, this risk is reduced by half for each extra caster, with 3 extra casters being the recommended number.</span>

    class=\"s1\">The Effects of Time Travel:</span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Time travel to the future is simple. Time travel to the past, however, creates a new history. Time travellers to the past alter the fabric of reality and change the future automatically as soon as they arrive. People in the present are unaware that the past is being altered, as memories change along with buildings and histories. If you make it obvious, intelligent beings and later historians will realise you were from the future. Once the spell has been activated the God’s blessing is no longer required, and the God might not even exist at the destination depending on time chosen. Depending on when they arrive, time travellers might find themselves disconnected from their deities, or cut off from their powers. A <span
    style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>Truesight</strong></span> spell will expose&nbsp;</span><span class=\"s1\"><span
    class=\"s1\">a time traveller, who will be detected as an alien planar entity, foreign to that reality. If travellers want to return to their time of origin, magic must exist as it was known in their original time, they will need a mage that knows this spell, and have the material components. (You cannot cast this spell during the historical Spellplague event for example. You can go there, but not leave).</span></span>
</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When a time traveller returns home to the present he will be confronted by an alternate version of himself, if he hasn’t erased himself already. Travellers&nbsp;can prevent themselves from being born and therefore be erased from history, but their current bodies and souls won’t be erased, since any creature or item that travels through time with this spell becomes automatically immune to changes in history and time paradoxes caused by this spell. Thus a traveller can kill his grandfather in the past and not be affected, but no one in his own time will recognise him on his return to an altered present. </span><span
    class=\"s1\">When they return they might not recognise their home time, as their actions in the past could have caused a wide variety of changes, decided by the DM. If a time traveller’s mind is read or if they tell others about this spell in the past, it could potentially lead to others learning the Time Travel spell, causing a potential spiral into chaos. Travelling to the past alters and erases the entire universe you came from, and replaces it with an alternate version. For this reason the spell is a complete secret and is nearly impossible to cast. The goddess of magic Mystra forbade the use of this spell after Karsus's Folly, however after her death it is unknown if the spell can be performed again.</span>

    to 100 rooms totalling no more than 250,000 sqft (or 10,000 5x5ft squares) and ceilings no higher than 50 ft. The
    appearance of the palace does not have to correspond to the floor plan; for example, the caster could create a
    palace with a totally flat floor plan, but choose to have the ethereal palace appear as a skinny tower to the
    exterior observer.</p>\r\n<p>The palace may be furnished with all manner of tools and facilities required by the

    grow weary while on the demiplane, and if they are brought to another plane of existence, they take 1d12 necrotic
    damage for each minute they spend outside the palace's demiplane. There are between 50 and 200 servants present in
    the palace at any one time, depending on the size and needs of the palace. Each servant can perform any task a
    normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another

    These defenders can be instructed to attack any creature who is not the caster, any creature who is not a creature

    damage of the given damage type.</p>\r\n<p>Creatures who rest in the palace for one week regain all of their hit
    points, even if they are suffering from a condition that would normally prevent them from regaining these hit
    points. The effects of curses, poisons, and diseases are suppressed while a creature remains in the palace after
    this amount of time as well. Creatures do not age while they reside in the palace, and the palace is always able to
    provide food, clothing, and other necessities to its residents, up to 100 residents. The palace is also able to
    provide its residents with mundane items that they require, such as ammunition, so long as the total value of items
    acquired this way does not exceed 500 gold.</p>\r\n<p>Once the duration has ended, the demiplane doe not cease to
    exist, but the ethereal palace does disappear. Any items or creatures in the palace remain there until they leave.
    The servants stop regarding the caster as the master of the palace, although they continue to follow the last orders
    they where given and serve any creatures inside the palace. The caster can no longer change the appearance, layout,
    or location of the palace until they cast the spell again. Any creature who attempts to leave the palace while the
    ethereal palace is no longer present in the plane it was conjured on previously will be placed in the nearest
    available free space to the palace's previous location, although there is a 5% chance (1 on a d20) that they are
    teleported to a random plane of existence instead.</p>\r\n<p>The only way for the caster, or any other creature, to
    re-enter the ethereal palace after it has disappeared, is to use the same silver key that was originally used to
    create the palace. The servants and guards will obey the instructions of a creature who holds the palaces' key, and
    a creature with they key can make a DC 20 (or the casters' spell save DC, whichever is higher) arcana check to find
    and open the portal to the palace if they are in the last location that it was summoned to. If a caster uses the
    same key to cast this spell a second time, they will summon the same ethereal palace, complete with any creatures or
    items that remain inside.&nbsp; If it has been more than 30 days since the last time the caster summoned the palace,
    there is a 5% chance that the spell fails to summon the same palace, and instead creates a new one. In this case,
    the original demiplane can only be linked back to the key by the use of a <em>wish</em> spell or similar magic.

<p>You bring into existence a being from another time and space. You summon a creature, which possesses extraplanar
    properties, and as a result is susceptible to banishment and any spells or abilities which affect extraplanar
    enemies.</p>\r\n<p>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes a form you choose that fits your origin.
    Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a
    aberration, celestial, fey, fiend or monstrosity (your choice) instead of a beast. The size of the form it can take
    and challenge rating increases with your character's level, consult the chart below and with your DM since some
    creature's might be too powerful or too big as a familiar.</p>\r\n<p>The time to cast the spell is increased by one
    hour per size increase of the creature.</p>\r\n<p>You may also mount your familiar if it has no fly speed,&nbsp;is
    at least one size larger than you, and has an appropriate anatomy that can serve as a mount. If you do so, you
    control the&nbsp;familiar in combat. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also
    target your familiar.</p>\r\n<p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In
    combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions
    as normal.&nbsp;Starting at 10th level it can make 1 attack using your bonus action, at 15th level it becomes a free
    action. At 20th level it can make 2 attacks as a free action.</p>\r\n<p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it
    disappears, leaving behind no physical form.&nbsp;At 5th level it has 1/2 the creatures normal hit points. At 10th
    level it has full hit points of the creature. At 15th level 1/4 of you hit points or its normal hit points which
    every is higher. At 20th level it has 1/4 plus 1 hit point for every character level.&nbsp; It reappears after you
    cast this spell again.&nbsp;If it does so while you are mounted on it, you can use your reaction to dismount it as
    it disappears and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall&nbsp;prone&nbsp;in a space within 5 feet
    of it.</p>\r\n<p>While your familiar is within 100 feet at 1st level, 125 at 5th, 150 at 10th, 175 at 15th and 200
    at 20th.&nbsp;of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through
    your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special
    senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. At 10th
    level, you can choose to use one sense of the familiar and keep the other, for example, you choose to see through
    the familiar and can still hear in your form but not through the familiar.</p>\r\n<p>As an action, you can
    temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons.&nbsp;If you
    do so while you are mounted on it, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it disappears and land on your feet.
    Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall&nbsp;prone&nbsp;in a space within 5 feet of it. It disappears into a pocket
    dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. Alternatively, you can dismiss it
    forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within
    30 feet of you.&nbsp;If your familiar loses hit points and is transported into the pocket dimension, the familiar
    regains 5 hit points for every hour it remains. Additionally any status effects or conditions that the familiar
    suffers from are cured if the familiar remains in the pocket dimension for the length of a long rest. Curses however
    remain, and cannot be cured in this way.</p>\r\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this
    spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the
    list below. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.&nbsp;You may do so while mounted, as long as the new
    form also&nbsp;has no fly speed,&nbsp;is at least one size larger than you, and has an appropriate anatomy that can
    serve as a mount; otherwise, you are dismounted and fall&nbsp;prone&nbsp;in a space within 5 feet of it.</p>\r\n<p>
    Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the
    spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you,&nbsp;&nbsp;at 1st level, 125 ft at 5th, 150 ft at 10th, 175 ft
    at 15th and 200 ft at 20th. and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell
    requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n
