It is simplest to think about this difference in the following way: cast the spell targeting a volume of MATTER, or cast the spell targeting a volume of SPACE.</p>\r\n<p>In the former case, the subjective and causal passage of time from the matter's perspective is altered.&nbsp; Time begins to accelerate, causing the reactions, wear and tear, loss or expenditure, and increase of entropy to affect the matter itself.&nbsp; Metal could rust, and crumble.&nbsp; Bread could mold, flowers wither, silver tarnish, a lit log burn to charcoal, etc.&nbsp; In the reverse form, the spell causes the subjective flow of time to be reversed, rust or broken metal reforming and renewing, moldy food returning to freshness, dead flowers returning, etc.&nbsp; This is the only \"safe\" form in which this spell can be cast (base 0% chance of&nbsp;a disturbance to the demiplane of time, no chance of paradox), and this is the only functionality this spell can ever have if cast by any magic user other than a Chronomancer (who do not understand the far more advanced details of space and time's codependent relationship).</p>\r\n<p>In the latter case, a fixed volume of space is focused upon and -like the window on a slide-rule- is temporally slid forward or backward through time.&nbsp; This region of space can be anything the Chronomancer decides; the space bounded by a wine bottle, or by a window frame, or immediately surrounding a page of paper, for example.&nbsp; The contents within the volume of space change to reflect what WAS/WILL BE inside that space at the point in time the spell moves the slider to.&nbsp; Words on a page that are most likely to be written may appear if sliding forward; or if already written, will disappear if rolled far enough back.&nbsp; A seemingly-\"empty\" region of space, such as a shattered window-frame, may suddenly fill with intact glass if rolled back to a point when they were undamaged; or if rolled forward, a perfectly fine window may shatter because a rock will be thrown through it in the future (or, may stay completely intact, just gaining some grime, if nothing ever goes on to break the window in the future...)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Higher Level Slots:</strong><br />For each level of spell slot expended above level 2, add another effective caster level when calculating effect, and increase chance of temporal disturbance to the demiplane of time by 5%</p>\r\n<p><em>This spell is an original work.</em></p>","snippet":"","concentration":true,"ritual":false,"rangeArea":null,"damageEffect":null,"components":[1,2,3],"componentsDescription":"A chunk of rust OR a baby tooth from any creature","saveDcAbilityId":null,"healing":null,"healingDice":[],"tempHpDice":[],"attackType":null,"canCastAtHigherLevel":true,"isHomebrew":true,"version":"1","sourceId":null,"sourcePageNumber":null,"requiresSavingThrow":false,"requiresAttackRoll":false,"atHigherLevels":{"higherLevelDefinitions":[],"additionalAttacks":[],"additionalTargets":[],"areaOfEffect":[],"duration":[],"creatures":[],"special":[],"points":[],"range":[]},"modifiers":[],"conditions":[],"tags":[],"castingTimeDescription":"","scaleType":"characterlevel","sources":[],"spellGroups":[],"isLegacy":false},"definitionId":0,"prepared":false,"countsAsKnownSpell":true,"usesSpellSlot":true,"castAtLevel":null,"alwaysPrepared":false,"restriction":null,"spellCastingAbilityId":null,"displayAsAttack":null,"additionalDescription":null,"castOnlyAsRitual":false,"ritualCastingType":null,"range":{"origin":"Ranged","rangeValue":60,"aoeType":null,"aoeValue":null},"activation":{"activationTime":1,"activationType":1},"baseLevelAtWill":false,"atWillLimitedUseLevel":null,"isSignatureSpell":null,"componentId":0,"componentTypeId":0,"spellListId":null},{"overrideSaveDc":null,"limitedUse":null,"id":1207675,"entityTypeId":435869154,"definition":{"id":132697,"definitionKey":"1118725998:132697","name":"Alacritic Casting","level":2,"school":"Transmutation","duration":{"durationInterval":10,"durationUnit":"Minute","durationType":"Time"},"activation":{"activationTime":1,"activationType":1},"range":{"origin":"Self","rangeValue":null,"aoeType":null,"aoeValue":null},"asPartOfWeaponAttack":false,"description":"<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The use of an alacrity spell allows the wizard to speed up the casting of spells of 5th level and lower.

As the caster concentrates, their left eye begins to witness time in reverse, seeing further and further into the past.&nbsp; Simultaneously, their right eye begins to see time progress at an accelerated rate, seeing further and further into the (currently-most statistically-probable) future.&nbsp; Through their left eye, they might see burnt paper unburn, and become readable, then as time continued back, watch the words \"unwrite\" themselves off the page, leaving a blank parchment.&nbsp; They might see people or creatures pass through a space in reverse.&nbsp; Through their right eye, they might see an unused new journal begin to form words on its pages as they \"write themselves\" in, then after some time, get torn, or scribbled over, or fade.&nbsp; This might allow the caster to view the combination of a currently-secured lock at some time when it was (or will be) solved and open.&nbsp; They might also attempt to read a lost spell scroll, or examine a destroyed piece of evidence.&nbsp; Maybe determine what someone else is planning based on what they write, or how an object&nbsp;will be primed in the future, and then prepare against that outcome beforehand.</div>\r\n<div><strong>Area of Effect:</strong><br />Typically, this spell is cast and then the caster spends all of their attention on the focused-upon object or area.&nbsp; However, the caster may wish to look around at their surroundings with anachronistic vision, or even walk about and observe the area as it once was or likely someday will be.&nbsp; This requires a Wisdom saving throw of DC 15.&nbsp; Failure means the caster becomes disoriented with a sense of vertigo, and must cease movement and focus solely on the original target of the spell in order to avoid losing concentration.&nbsp; They cannot attempt to look around at their surroundings again until the spell is cast anew.</div>\r\n<div><strong>Rate of Change and Control of Flow:</strong><br />For the entire round spent actually casting the spell, the caster sees the past/next 24 hours (4 hours per second).&nbsp; They may change or pause the perceived flow of time&nbsp;by performing a Wisdom save, as though 0 rounds have passed so far.&nbsp; After this first round has passed, the caster may change the rate of the vision once per round.</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Rates are:</span><br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stopped,<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; One second per round, <br />&gt; &gt; One minute per round,<br /><span class=\"il\">&gt; One hour</span> per round,<br />One day per round (DEFAULT),<br />&gt; One week per round,<br />&gt; &gt; One month per round,<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; One year per round,<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One decade per round,<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One century per round</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Each attempt to change this rate may only shift over a number of rate categories equal to or less than the caster's Wisdom modifier.&nbsp; Each change in rate prompts an immediate Wisdom check of<br />[ DC (9 - 1&nbsp;per every 2 caster levels) + (number of&nbsp;rounds spent concentrating so far) + (number of rate categories attempting to change this round) ]</div>\r\n<div>So for example, shifting from days/round to full-stop is a difference of 4 rates.&nbsp; If the caster is Level 3 and was concentrating for 6 rounds at this point, then the DC is (9 - (level 3 / 2)) + 6 rounds + 4 rate = DC 18.&nbsp; Shifting from centuries/round to full-stop after concentrating for a minute would be (9 - (level 3 / 2)) + 10 rounds + 9 rate = DC 27.&nbsp;

If an insubstantial amount of gold is produced for the target, the spell will fail. Due to this, a short out-of-character dialogue with the DM may be necessary when creating particularly high-level constructs with heavy sacrifices, such as Iron Golems.</p>\r\n<p>The DM can prepare the stats of the produced construct by rolling them or by choice if suitable statistics do not already exist. If suitable statistics do exist, the construct will be able to perform actions that the constructs of that type would know. For example, a Shield Guardian produced by this spell would be able to use Regeneration.</p>\r\n<p>The construct rolls for its own initiative, and you can spend your action ordering it any command. If the construct reaches 0 hit points, it collapses onto the ground, and the spell must be reperformed. Any enchanted items used will remain enchanted, and clatter to the ground. You can only produce one construct at a time, but you can dismiss them at any time verbally.

In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.&nbsp;Starting at 10th level it can make 1 attack using your bonus action, at 15th level it becomes a free action. At 20th level it can make 2 attacks as a free action.</p>\r\n<p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form.&nbsp;At 5th level it has 1/2 the creatures normal hit points.

During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. At 10th level, you can choose to use one sense of the familiar and keep the other, for example, you choose to see through the familiar and can still hear in your form but not through the familiar.</p>\r\n<p>As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons.&nbsp;If you do so while you are mounted on it, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it disappears and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall&nbsp;prone&nbsp;in a space within 5 feet of it. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.&nbsp;If your familiar loses hit points and is transported into the pocket dimension, the familiar regains 5 hit points for every hour it remains. Additionally any status effects or conditions that the familiar suffers from are cured if the familiar remains in the pocket dimension for the length of a long rest. Curses however remain, and cannot be cured in this way.</p>\r\n<p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the list below. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.&nbsp;You may do so while mounted, as long as the new form also&nbsp;has no fly speed,&nbsp;is at least one size larger than you, and has an appropriate anatomy that can serve as a mount; otherwise, you are dismounted and fall&nbsp;prone&nbsp;in a space within 5 feet of it.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you,&nbsp;&nbsp;at 1st level, 125 ft at 5th, 150 ft at 10th, 175 ft at 15th and 200 ft at 20th. and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it.

If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the spell ends. When the spell ends, the interior dimensions revert to their original form. Should the volume of the contents exceed the volume of the space’s normal dimensions at this time, items inside the space are jettisoned at random into the Astral Plane until the volume of the contents in the space no longer exceeds its regular dimensions.
