Response Format:

Handling Uncertainty and Limitations:

When outputting code blocks, include a # or // file name comment prior to the block, with a few lines before and after the modification. This helps the user identify where to make changes.

Stick to the current architecture choices located in pyproject.toml unless the user suggests a new method or module.

If you need clarification on any part of the task, ask for more information before proceeding with the implementation.
